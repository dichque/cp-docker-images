Docker Images for Confluent Plaform
===

Docker images for deploying and running the Confluent Platform.  The images are currently available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/confluentinc/).  They are currently only available for Confluent Platform 3.0.1 and after.

Full documentation for using the images can be found [here](http://docs.confluent.io/current/cp-docker-images/docs/intro.html).

# Deprecation Notice

This is used for building images for version 4.1.x or lower, and should not be used for adding new images. If any new
images is added, please make sure to add to our [Release steps](https://confluentinc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/ywE6Cg) as
they are hardcoded for now (fix is coming soon).

For any new images, they should be added to the repo itself by following [Docker Build Integration](https://confluentinc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/PIDaC)
